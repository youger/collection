------------ | ------------- |
**[AnimatedTransitionGallery](https://github.com/shu223/AnimatedTransitionGallery)** | Collection of iOS 7 custom animated transitions using `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` protocol.
**[pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop)** | Pop is an extensible animation engine for iOS and OS X.

The API allows quick integration with existing Objective-C codebases and enables the animation of any property on any object. It's a mature and well-tested framework that drives all the animations and transitions in `Paper`.

### Swizzling

   name      |     desc      |
------------ | ------------- |
**[Aspects](https://github.com/steipete/Aspects)** | Think of Aspects as method swizzling on steroids. It allows you to add code to existing methods per class or per instance, whilst thinking of the insertion point e.g. before/instead/after. Aspects automatically deals with calling super and is easier to use than regular method swizzling.

### Third realized

------------ | ------------- |
**[AsyncDisplayKit](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit)** | AsyncDisplayKit is an iOS framework that keeps even the most complex user interfaces smooth and responsive. It was originally built to make Facebook's Paper possible, and goes hand-in-hand with pop's physics-based animations â€” but it's just as powerful with UIKit Dynamics and conventional app designs.
**[BeeFramework](http://github.com/gavinkwoe/BeeFramework)** | A semi-hybrid framework that allows you to create mobile apps using Objective-C and XML/CSS <http://www.bee-framework.com>
